At its core, Docker is about containers. A container is a lightweight, standalone, executable package that includes everything needed to run a piece of software, including the code, runtime, libraries, and system tools. Containers are isolated from each other and the host system, ensuring consistent operation regardless of where the container is deployed. Now, let's see some terminology and concepts that revolve around this \"container\" thing:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Images: Containers are created from Docker images. An image is a lightweight, standalone, and executable software package that includes everything needed to run a container: code, runtime, system tools, libraries, and settings. Docker images are built from a Dockerfile, which is a script composed of various commands and arguments that define the image.</p> </li> <li> <p>Dockerfile: A Dockerfile is a text document that contains all the commands a user could call on the command line to assemble an image. Using <code>docker build</code> users can create an image from a Dockerfile.</p> </li> <li> <p>Docker Hub and Registries: Docker Hub is a service provided by Docker for finding and sharing container images with your team. Private and public repositories can be used to host container images. Other registries include AWS Elastic Container Registry, Google Container Registry, etc.</p> </li> <li> <p>Portability and Consistency: Docker ensures that an application works seamlessly in any environment. A Docker container runs identically whether on a developer\u2019s laptop, a test server, or in production, which eliminates the \u201cit works on my machine\u201d problem.</p> </li> <li> <p>Microservices Architecture: Docker is conducive to microservices architecture \u2013 a design approach to build a single application as a suite of small services, each running in its own container.</p> </li> <li> <p>Docker Compose: For defining and running multi-container Docker applications. With Compose, you use a YAML file to configure your application\u2019s services, networks, and volumes, and then create and start all the services from your configuration with a single command.</p> </li> <li> <p>Docker Swarm: Docker\u2019s orchestration and cluster management tool. Swarm lets you manage a cluster of Docker hosts and deploy application services to them in a scalable, reliable way.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Docker simplifies the deployment of applications, as it allows them to be bundled with all of their dependencies into a single container. This can greatly reduce conflicts between teams running different software on the same infrastructure.</p>"},{"location":"Docker/#minimal-docker-example-an-hello-world-app-in-python","title":"Minimal docker example: an hello world app in python","text":""},{"location":"Docker/#create-the-python-application","title":"Create the Python Application","text":"<p>First, we'll create a simple Python script.
